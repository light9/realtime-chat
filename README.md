> Demo of a realtime chat app using Feathers.js

## About
This app uses feathers.js as a REST framework on the backend. It allows for rapid development of APIs using NodeJS, using hooks to protect endpoints from unintended access.

This simple app, using Angular, allows users to register, login and chat with all other users, realtime, using Feathers and the Socket.IO JavaScript library.
